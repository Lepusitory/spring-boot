== Observability

Observability is the ability to observe the internal state of a running system from the outside.
It consists of the three pillars logging, metrics and traces.

For metrics and traces, Spring Boot uses https://micrometer.io/docs/observation[Micrometer Observation].
To create your own observations (which will lead to metrics and traces), you can inject an `ObservationRegistry`.

include::code:MyCustomObservation[]

NOTE: Low cardinality tags will be added to metrics and traces, while high cardinality tags will only be added to traces.

Beans of type `ObservationPredicate`, `GlobalObservationConvention` and `ObservationHandler` will be automatically registered on the `ObservationRegistry`.
You can additionally register any number of `ObservationRegistryCustomizer` beans to further configure the registry.

For more details please see the https://micrometer.io/docs/observation[Micrometer Observation documentation].

TIP: Observability for JDBC and R2DBC can be configured using separate projects.
For JDBC, the https://github.com/jdbc-observations/datasource-micrometer[Datasource Micrometer project] provides a Spring Boot starter which automatically creates observations when JDBC operations are invoked.
Read more about it https://jdbc-observations.github.io/datasource-micrometer/docs/current/docs/html/[in the reference documentation].
For R2DBC, the https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/r2dbc-micrometer-spring-boot[Spring Boot Auto Configuration for R2DBC Observation] creates observations for R2DBC query invocations.

Observability support relies on the https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/context-propagation[Context Propagation library] for forwarding the current observation across threads and reactive pipelines.
`ThreadLocal` values are automatically reinstated in reactive operators, this behavior is controlled with the configprop:spring.reactor.context-propagation[] property.

The next sections will provide more details about logging, metrics and traces.
